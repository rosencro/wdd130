    <p>Hello hello, everyone! I'm Cora, and I'm excited to be a part of this class!</p>
    <p>I'm currently Majoring in Art with an emphasis in Illustration, and I'm having a wonderful time with it! Creating art, whether it be digital or traditional, has always been a huge part of my life. Might as well do something with it, right? I'm planning to write and illustrate books, and I have a goal to publish my own fairytale-type storybook one day! Other hobbies of mine include singing, creating (very) short songs in Garageband, writing, handsewing, reading, crafting, and delving deep into the stories of my favorite shows, books, and games.</p>
    <p>As far as family standing goes, I'm the oldest of six kids. My siblings can be a bit wild, but I love them for it. My parents are wonderful people who I'm grateful for helping support me and my decision to go to college. I'm thankful they've stuck with me so far!</p>
    <p>Web Design is a skill I felt like I should learn due to the ever-increasing digital presence in the world today. I figured it's a good thing to know how things work behind the scenes a bit. Not to mention it'll give me practice for when I want to make a site to showcase my art (besides, learning the basics of building a webpage is also something I've been SUPER curious about.)</p>
    <p>I'm thrilled to find out what this course will bring!</p>
