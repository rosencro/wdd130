                <h3>
                    My name is Cressida Rosenthall, aka Crescent Rose!

                    <h3>The BIG Things:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Despite being largely self-taught throughout my life, I'm currently in school, majoring in Art (big surprise there) with an emphasis in Illustration. I'm very excited to put my major to use and publish an illustrated book in the future. 
                        Much of my artistic inspiration draws from a number of sources, but I look up to Tony DiTerlizzi, Riley S. Quinn, Liz Lemon Swindle, and Shirley Barber specifically. Their unique styles of art scratch particular niches in my brain that nobody else can. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I adore all kinds of storytelling. I love the variety of formats— images, music, video, games, words— it's absolutely fascinating and magical to me that we, as human beings, have found and created so many ways to communicate feelings and experiences  and ideas to one another. It's one of the reasons I love the kind of art I do. You can tell a whole story- or inspire a whole story- with just a single image. How amazing is that?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love colors and anything that glows and sparkles- this definitely influences my art. You'll find a lot of pieces where a character is holding some kind of unnatural light source or has some kind of jewelry. Bonus points if there's a precious stone involved. I'm basically a crow in human disguise. 
                     
                        My favorite places are forests- boreal or temperate- and mountains. They're so full of life and so close to the sky- stargazing in these locations is absolutely magical.

                        My favorite time of day is dusk, just after the sun has set, and the first stars are beginning to glimmer into visibility. My second favorite time is midnight because, surprise, surprise, I love the moon! I love the mystery and the science, the myths and the logistics. The beautiful chunk of space rock draws a marvelous blend of fact and fiction to it that satisfies the creator and the researcher within.

                        Fantasy and sci-fi are my favorite genres. There's so much opportunity for character creation, and the rules within those worlds are a bit more… flexible than those in more realistic settings.
