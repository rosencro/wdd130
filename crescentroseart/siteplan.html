      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>

        Hiya hey, welcome to the gallery! 
        
        This is a collection of various art from recent years, ranging from 2019 to the present! It's set up into different sections to help it be less overwhelming, and make perusing a lot easier.
        There's a wide variety of style conventionally 'good' art here. As a continually growing artist, I decided to include some of the work I'm less proud of. It shows how much I've grown and helps normalize that as an artist, you don't need to produce a masterpiece every time. Being an artist is about creating, whether or not your creation is the next “Starry Night”. And remember that you're still an artist, even if your most recent works are simply doodles in the margins of a notebook. 
        Anyway, inspirational uplifting artist-talk aside, please enjoy this virtual gallery of my art!
        
        
        
        Traditional Artwork
        
        Traditional Art is what most people think of when you talk about art. Traditional Art typically includes works done in pencil, pen, charcoal, pastels, paints, inks, clays, etc. These are works that are done physically, without the aid of a digital program (like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator or Clip Studio Paint).

        Digital Artwork
        
        Digital Artwork is a form of  non-traditional art where the artist creates their work using some kind of program that mimics the medium they wish to work in. Programs like this include Adobe Photoshop/Adobe Illustrator, Clip Studio Paint, Krita, or even MS Paint. Digital art typically offers a kind of flexibility that traditional art cannot by way of being able to edit layers beneath the top layer, the magic of the undo button, duplicating/warping selected areas, etc. Contrary to popular misconception, the software most digital artists use DOES NOT create the art for them. Software that creates art for you is almost always some kind of AI software (programs/software like Midjourney or Dall-E), which artists do not widely consider to be real art. (For more on that, see my FAQ page :)

      <h3>FAQs & Such</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the FAQ section! 

        These are a wide variety of Questions that I get asked regularly as an artist “in the wild”, so to speak. I've also included a section of comments I hear along with the questions, because they usually come hand-in-hand. And to round it all off, I added a section of general etiquette by the bottom of the page to help when speaking to artists so as not to cause unnecessary awkwardness or annoyance.
         
         The Questions and Answers:
        Q: “How long have you been an artist/drawing?” 
        A: Pretty much since I was a little kid and playing around with Crayola watercolors. I just got drawn in from there, y'know? I've had years and years to practice.
        Q: “Is drawing hard?”
        A: Yes and no. Sometimes. It can be hard when I'm art-blocked and burned out. That can last anywhere from a day or two to a week or more. Other times, drawing and creating art feels easy and so much fun- these are usually times when my battery is nice and charged and I'm good to go.
        Q: “Where do you get your ideas from?” 
        A: Oh, all over the place. I get ideas from some of my favorite media (like books and shows and such), from friends, from little things on the internet (ranging from writing prompts to memes), and, oftentimes, my own mind. There's never just one source.
        Q: “So like… you drew all of this from your head?” (Usually a follow-up to the one above, or when I'm caught doodling)
        A: Yep. Not all artists need to have their subject in front of them for hours at a time. References are really helpful- like live sketching or having a photo- don't get me wrong, but they're not technically necessary. They're super helpful, though.
        Q: “Can you draw me?” (Heard this one ALL THE TIME in middle school)
        A: The answer to that is “Sure, but not for free.”. I have a page with the details of my commission prices you can look at. 
        Q: “Are you a good artist?” 
        A: The definition of what makes art 'good' is highly subjective. Do you mean 'good' like, classically? Or 'good' stylistically? Or 'good' in a dozen other ways? It really depends on what your tastes are, but yes, I like to think I'm a good artist. I've come a long, long way from where I started, and to me, that means I'm doing well. As long as I'm improving and learning, I'll consider myself a 'good' artist.
        Q: “Can you draw other styles?” 
        A: That's actually a skill I've been getting into more recently! It's not easy, but with enough practice, I can style-match fairly well. It won't be exact, because I'll never be able to completely mask my own style, but it'll be pretty close.
        Q: “Do you do commissions?” 
        A: Why yes, I do! I have a whole page dedicated to that information here. 
        Q: “Why are your commissions so expensive?”
        A: Because I'm providing a service that's not necessary to your life. The reality is that art is less of a 'need' and more of a 'want', and I'm spending my time and effort on something for someone else- not to mention physical art supplies cost real, actual money, and are often not cheap. Being an artist is expensive. It's one of the reasons I like digital art so much, I don't have to buy paints or canvases or markers nearly as often.
        Q: “How did you learn to draw like that?”
        A: Years and years of practice. I've been teaching myself ever since I was little. I found art books and tutorials and other artists to learn from, and they influenced me until I was able to get into college and take some real art classes. So at this point in time, I consider myself a self-taught/school-taught artist. 
        Q: “What do you like to draw?” 
        A: Anything fantasy or sci-fi related. My own characters. Silly or serious or mystical stuff. Those kinds of things.
        Q: “Wait, what's wrong with AI art?” (Almost ALWAYS the follow up when I express a negative opinion on it)
        A: Oh, a number of things—which is a shame because it has potential, but I digress— one of the foremost being how artists EVERYWHERE are having their work stolen and fed through various AI algorithms to produce the images they are prompted for. And yes, I say stolen because many, if not all, of these artists were never approached and asked if their art could be used in the algorithms' databases. It's been a problem for a while, but started getting noticed more recently when the AI generators started trying to produce the artists' signatures on the images it produced. The second biggest issue I see is people feeding their prompts into an AI image generator and then trying to say “Look, I made that! I'm an artist now!” Not to be rude, but no. No you didn't. The only thing you actually did was write the prompt, not create the art. You're an AI prompter, not an AI artist. It's super frustrating and annoying to see that while real artists are actually putting lots of time and effort into their craft, these people just type a few sentences, request a style, and get an art piece in a relatively short amount of time. It undermines real artists and hurts the art community as a larger whole. I could go on, but that's all I'll say on the subject for now.
        The Comments and Responses:
        C: “Wow, I could never do that.” 
        R: Yes, you could. Now, it wouldn't be the same as mine, because we would have different styles, but with practice, you could. 
        C: “You're so talented!” (I can't tell you how many times I've heard this one.)
        R: A talent is any interest or skill you decide to nurture and pursue and grow. I just had a lot of interest in art and pursued it throughout my life, allowing me to grow the skill into what it is today. 
        C: “I can't even draw a stick figure.” 
        R: Please, I seriously doubt that. Plus, there's nothing inherently wrong with drawing stick figures. My mom would draw them for me during church meetings, and I adored them. I'm sure your stick figures are lovely.
        
        
        Alrighty- here's what I'm going to call the ETIQUETTE PSA section. This is a series of what not to say to an artist unless you want to make them frustrated with you. And if you're the type who thinks it's funny to make people mad… who hurt you? Stop reading and go get some therapy. It's good for you.
        
        Anyway, let's jump in. 
        
        “Is that anime??”
        Please, for the love of all that is holy, stop asking this question. We hear it so much.
        Unless the artist is actually drawing anime, don't ask. Not every character with stylized eyes and a small nose is “anime”. This isn't even factoring in the different styles within the anime community and the wider art community as a whole, why make anime the default? You have so many styles to choose from.
        This can be super super discouraging for artists trying to find their own style and having it constantly compared to something it's not. Seriously.
        What do to instead:
        Think of something else to ask. Or better yet, find something to compliment about the drawing! 
        Example: “I like the way you draw eyes!” or “I love the hair, it looks great!”
        Just don't ask that question. Please.
        
        “Woah, is that [insert character]?”
        This gets said a lot, and it gets really old really fast. 
        Again, unless the artist is actually drawing that character, don't ask. Wait until you're sure, or they say something about it. 
        This is another instance of comparison being the thief of joy. By comparing the person or character the artist is drawing, it makes them feel like their creation is unoriginal, uninspired, and can really sting. 
        From personal experience and experiences I've heard from fellow artists, this is a super, super annoying question/comment. There's a time and a place for everything, and this is no exception. 
        What to do instead:
        DON'T. ASK. 
        Compliment the character design, like the hair or the outfit choices. 
        Example: “Woah, I love the jewelry you added there!” or “Nice art! It looks really cool. I like how you drew the [insert feature here].”
        “Why does it look like that?”
        This can be seen as just rude. 
        It's hurtful and ignorant and comes off as an intentional attack. 
        It sounds like you're making fun of their skills/lack of skills. 
        What to do instead:
        Literally just don't say anything. 
        “It looks great, but…”
        Anything that starts like this is usually called “constructive” criticism, but it's literally just someone's way of trying to hurt the artists feelings but have an easy way out if they're called out on it. 
        Examples include: “It looks great, but they don't look right. The face looks… wrong.” or “It looks great, but I don't like the colors. They're too [bright/dull/much/ etc].” 
        And when they're called out: “It's not my fault they can't take constructive criticism!” “Wow, I was just trying to help *eyeroll emoji here*”.
        What to do instead: 
        Don't be rude. Don't look for things to nitpick or 'fix'. That's literally not your job. 
        Politely ask if the artist would like criticism or check and see if they say they want it. Comments like this are almost always unwarranted.
         “Why are they naked?”
        If I had a dollar for every time I was asked this, I'd have enough money to buy two or three more tubes of oil paint.
        Chances are that the artist is in a transition stage from blocking in the form of the figure they're drawing and moving on to details like clothes. For example, I personally draw the figure first so I know how the outfit will be shaped around it. Everyone has a different process, but this is one I see more often.
        Also, keep in mind that if the artist is indeed moving on to details, you've just commented on a rough sketch of vaguely humanoid shapes and called it naked. Think about it for a minute.
        If the figure is, indeed, naked, it's not something you need to point out. 
        This is one way classically trained artists learn how to draw properly- they need to learn the anatomy of the human body, otherwise their art of people won't look right. It just so happens that it's easiest to see how the muscles interact with light and shadow when the body is nude, or very close to it.
        A lot of nudity is seen in traditional art; it's seen as a celebration of the human form and an example of the artist's mastery of their craft. They know how to paint a human being and make them look human. 
        What to do instead:
        Ask politely if you can see what they're working on (even if you've already seen it). Respect their choice if they say no. If they say yes, then compliment their work.
        Example: “Hey, can I see what you're working on?” (No) “Oh, okay.” (Yes) “It looks good so far! You're doing great!”
        Don't announce it to the world, please. Mind your own business.
        Example: (You sit there in silence and find something else to do with your time.)
        
        Just some takeaways for you, and anyone who didn't bother to read through the whole thing:
        
        BE POLITE. 
        If you catch an artist drawing in public, be nice and don't watch creepily over their shoulder. Ask politely if you can watch or see what they're doing.
        RESPECT THEIR CHOICES.
        If they say no, leave them alone. You're not entitled to their work.
        DON'T BE ANNOYING.
        Think before you speak, PLEASE. Try to recognize the effects your words may have on them. 
        DON'T COMPARE THEIR ART TO SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK.
        It's not a fair comparison anyways because of the variations in skill and style. 
        DON'T BE RUDE.
        This is just a rule to being a decent human being living on Earth. It's not hard to keep negative thoughts to yourself. Please, just be kind and polite.
        
        
        This list may expand as time goes on, but this is what I have so far.

      <hr3>About the Artist</hr3>
      <p>
        Well hello! 

        My name is Cressida Rosenthall, aka Crescent Rose! 
        
        The BIG Things:
        
        Despite being largely self-taught throughout my life, I'm currently in school, majoring in Art (big surprise there) with an emphasis in Illustration. I'm very excited to put my major to use and publish an illustrated book in the future. 
        Much of my artistic inspiration draws from a number of sources, but I look up to Tony DiTerlizzi, Riley S. Quinn, Liz Lemon Swindle, and Shirley Barber specifically. Their unique styles of art scratch particular niches in my brain that nobody else can. 
        I adore all kinds of storytelling. I love the variety of formats— images, music, video, games, words— it's absolutely fascinating and magical to me that we, as human beings, have found and created so many ways to communicate feelings and experiences  and ideas to one another. It's one of the reasons I love the kind of art I do. You can tell a whole story- or inspire a whole story- with just a single image. How amazing is that?
        
        The little Fun Details:
        I love colors and anything that glows and sparkles- this definitely influences my art. You'll find a lot of pieces where a character is holding some kind of unnatural light source or has some kind of jewelry. Bonus points if there's a precious stone involved. I'm basically a crow in human disguise. 
        My favorite time of day is dusk, just after the sun has set, and the first stars are beginning to glimmer into visibility. My second favorite time is midnight because, surprise, surprise, I love the moon! I love the mystery and the science, the myths and the logistics. The beautiful chunk of space rock draws a marvelous blend of fact and fiction to it that satisfies the creator and the researcher within. 
        Fantasy and sci-fi are my favorite genres. There's so much opportunity for character creation, and the rules within those worlds are a bit more… flexible than those in more realistic settings. 
        My favorite places are forests- boreal or temperate- and mountains. They're so full of life and so close to the sky- stargazing in these locations is absolutely magical.
