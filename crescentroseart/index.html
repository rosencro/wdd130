                    There's not a lot to say except Happy Birthday to the site! Today's the day Crescent Rose Art goes live and well! I'm really excited to share my art with everyone, and I'm so grateful for the support I received along the way that helped get me so far. Thank you all so, so much. I hope that with your continued support, this site will be able to grow and my art will be shown to more people!
